# terraform-me-that

This repo collects [Terraform](terraform.io) configurations to provision that, be it a vm, a container, a kubernetes service

Many thanks go to vendor documentation team, public forums contributors, as I learn&research ways to integrate new pieces into a working infrastructure

Current plan is to do this for various IaaS providers (AWS, GCP, IBM, Azure), etc.
Pull request welcome. Issues reporting appreciated.
